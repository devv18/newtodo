# newtodo
# todo-website
i have uploaded all the files and you have to keep them  all in one file to tun the project 
and i have used the django rest framework and i have written the unit test too.
i have done lot of work to get the project kindly review my code .
coming to views i have used the generic apiviews to get done 
i have used the todo model to get data 

it has all crud operationes 

1. read
2. update
3. delete
4. list
5. create
wehave to use /api/ befeore the calling of api


example: https://local host/api/read/3
do
for read,update and delete use the id to get the specfic object 

i will provide you the postman collection link once view it :

the django model has the date , end date and title , description and tags and these are handled by the serializers..


 the unit test code is written in tests.py 
 we can use the command  python manage.py test part1.tests to verify test code
